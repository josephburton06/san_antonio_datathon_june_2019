## This repo contains a master_sso notebook.  This notebook used data provided by SAWS for the CivTechSA Datathon held in June 2019.  For this event, I worked with two others from Codeup to offer insights and create proof of concept models.  Our focus was on sanitation sewer overflows (SSO's).

## Our presentation was awarded 'Most Solvable'.

## The proof of concept notebook is included.  There was not a lot of data to try and predict SSO's, so we used the idea that monitoring flow can help predict when a pipe will reach 80% clogged in order to be cleaned prior to an SSO occuring.

## The proof of concept helper functions are functions to create a mock pipeline and flow data that can be used in a polynomial regression model.  Discussions with SAWS informed them that other features can be used if data was available.
